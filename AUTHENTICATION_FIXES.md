# Authentication and Cross-Domain Cookie Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. The 401 Unauthorized Error (Cookie Configuration Issue)
- Fixed cookie settings in `jwtToken.js` with proper `sameSite: 'None'` (capitalized) and `secure: true` options
- Updated the logout function to use the same cookie options for consistency
- Added more detailed logging to the auth middleware to help diagnose cookie issues
- Added fallback to Authorization header when cookies are not received

### 2. The 404 Not Found Error (Login Form Issue)
- Added additional logging in the login form to track API call issues
- Ensured the correct URL path is used for login requests
- Added error handling with detailed error messages

### 3. Cross-Origin Authentication
- Implemented a multi-layered authentication strategy:
  1. Cookie-based authentication (primary)
  2. Authorization header with Bearer token (fallback)
  3. Local storage token persistence (last resort)
- Added axios interceptor to automatically add the token to requests

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
1. **Cookie Configuration** (`backend/utils/jwtToken.js`):
   - Fixed capitalization of `sameSite: 'None'` (was 'none')
   - Ensured `secure: true` for production environments
   - Added improved logging

2. **Auth Middleware** (`backend/middlewares/auth.js`):
   - Added support for Authorization header token
   - Improved error logging
   - Added request debugging information

3. **Logout Function** (`backend/controllers/userController.js`):
   - Updated to use the same cookie configuration as login
   - Ensured cookies are properly cleared across domains

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Authentication Interceptor** (`frontend/src/App.jsx`):
   - Added axios interceptor to include token in Authorization header
   - Improved token extraction and management

2. **Login Component** (`frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.jsx`):
   - Added token storage in localStorage
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Ensured consistent authentication state

3. **OAuth Callback** (`frontend/src/components/Auth/OAuthCallback.jsx`):
   - Added token extraction from cookies to localStorage
   - Enhanced error handling

4. **App Authentication** (`frontend/src/App.jsx`):
   - Implemented a robust token retrieval mechanism
   - Added fallback to localStorage when cookies aren't available
   - Improved authentication state management

## Testing the Solution

1. Login with email/password should work
2. Login with Google OAuth should work
3. Protected routes should be accessible after login
4. Authentication should persist across page refreshes
5. Logout should properly clear all authentication tokens

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure both frontend and backend use HTTPS
2. Verify that environment variables are properly set in production
3. Make sure Google OAuth callback URL is correct
4. Test authentication flow in the production environment

These fixes ensure robust authentication across domains and provide fallback mechanisms when cookies are blocked or not properly received by the server.
