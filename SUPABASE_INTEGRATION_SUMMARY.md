# Supabase Resume Storage Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation replaces Cloudinary with Supabase for resume storage in the JobZee application. The integration provides:

1. **File Storage:** Resume files stored in Supabase Storage
2. **Database Records:** Resume metadata stored in a Supabase table
3. **User Interface:** Upload, preview, and delete capabilities in the frontend

## Completed Tasks

### Backend Implementation

- [x] Created `config/supabase.js` for Supabase client initialization
- [x] Implemented `services/resumeService.js` with upload, retrieve, and delete functions
- [x] Updated `middlewares/upload.js` to use memory storage for Supabase uploads
- [x] Added resume handling in `controllers/userController.js`
- [x] Created API endpoints in `routes/userRouter.js`:
  - POST /profile/resume
  - GET /profile/resume
  - GET /profile/resume/:userId
  - DELETE /profile/resume/:resumeId

### Frontend Implementation

- [x] Created `ResumePreview.jsx` component for displaying PDF/image resumes
- [x] Added resume management UI in the Profile component:
  - Upload UI with file input
  - Preview functionality
  - Delete functionality
- [x] Implemented proper styling for the resume section

### Database & Storage

- [x] Created SQL script (`supabase/resumes_table.sql`) for:
  - Creating the resumes table
  - Setting up the storage bucket
  - Configuring Row Level Security policies

### Testing & Verification

- [x] Created utility scripts:
  - `scripts/test-supabase.js` for testing the integration
  - `scripts/list-resumes.js` for viewing database records
  - `scripts/list-storage-files.js` for viewing storage files

### Documentation

- [x] Created detailed documentation:
  - `supabase/README.md` - Overview and setup instructions
  - `supabase/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step setup guide
  - `supabase/CHECKLIST.md` - Implementation verification checklist
  - `backend/scripts/README.md` - Script usage instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the SQL Script:**
   - Run the SQL script from `supabase/resumes_table.sql` in your Supabase dashboard

2. **Test the Integration:**
   - Run the test script: `node backend/scripts/test-supabase.js`
   - Start both frontend and backend servers
   - Test the full user flow: upload → preview → delete

3. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Check that files appear in the Storage bucket
   - Confirm that records appear in the resumes table

## Security Considerations

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own resumes
- Storage bucket has appropriate public/private settings
- API endpoints verify user authentication before allowing operations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console and backend logs for specific errors
2. Verify Supabase credentials in `config.env`
3. Ensure the SQL script ran successfully
4. Use the utility scripts to verify database and storage state
5. Check network requests in browser dev tools for API errors

## Future Enhancements

- Add progress indicator for resume uploads
- Implement file type and size validation on the frontend
- Add resume versioning capability
- Enable employers to download applicant resumes
- Add batch resume export functionality
