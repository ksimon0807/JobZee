# File Upload Fix for Resume and Avatar

## Issues Identified

After implementing the OAuth authentication fixes, file uploads for resumes and profile pictures stopped working. The issues were:

1. **Token Transmission**: The frontend wasn't sending the token in the Authorization header for file upload requests
2. **Middleware Conflicts**: Possible conflicts between multer and express-fileupload middleware
3. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling and logging made diagnosis difficult

## Changes Made

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Token in File Upload Requests** (`frontend/src/components/Profile/Profile.jsx`):
   - Added the token from localStorage to the Authorization header in file upload requests
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
   - Added better logging to track request flow

### Backend Fixes

1. **Upload Middleware** (`backend/middlewares/upload.js`):
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose upload issues
   - Improved error handling for file type and size validation

2. **Express File Upload Configuration** (`backend/app.js`):
   - Added documentation to clarify the purpose of different file upload middleware
   - Added debug option to help with troubleshooting

## How File Uploads Work

The system uses two different file upload mechanisms:

1. **Profile Pictures (Avatar)**: Uses Cloudinary with multer middleware
2. **Resume Files**: Uses Supabase Storage with multer's memory storage

Both file upload paths now include:
- The authentication token in the Authorization header (fallback for cookie auth)
- Detailed error logging
- Better user feedback via toast messages

## Testing the Fix

1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Try uploading a profile picture (avatar)
4. Try uploading a resume file
5. Check that both uploads complete successfully
6. Verify that the uploads are visible in the profile

## Troubleshooting

If uploads still fail:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Check server logs for any authentication or upload errors
3. Verify that Cloudinary and Supabase credentials are correct
4. Make sure file sizes are within limits (2MB for avatars, 5MB for resumes)
